	<h2>about me</h2>
	<p>I grew up in New Hampshire and moved to Philadelphia six years ago. Currently, I live in West Philly with three roommates and a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/trashcatwallace/">cat who has his own Facebook page</a>.</p>
	<p>I've been interested in writing and visual arts as long as I can remember— I've always been passionate about the act of bringing life and expression into an idea, and the puzzle of working out <i>how</i> it should be put together so the audience will experience the same story and emotion that I have in my head. To me, web development is very much the same.</p>
	<p>Writing a screenplay involves translating a concept into a more concrete story outline and then into the format of a script. A website has to go from a brief to mock-ups and then into code, and personally I think they present a lot of similar challenges— a screenwriter has to remember the constraints of film (you can't write that the audience smells something, for example) and a programmer has to consider the strengths and weaknesses of the coding languages they're using. Story-tellers have to plan what information they give out, and in what order, and how, very strategically. I think good UI/UX design should do the same.</p>
